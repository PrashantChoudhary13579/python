# Here we are learning about taking user input values which is used to get the values from the user and store it in a variable.
# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
# print ("Welcome",name,".Ok, you are",age,"Years old, Not bad!!")
# print(type(name))
# print(type(age))
# umar = int (age)
# print(umar)
# print(type(umar))

# taking some values 

# name = input("Enter the name ")
# age = int(input("Enter the age "))
# marks = float(input("Enter your marks "))
# print ("Welcome,",name)
# print ("Congrats on being,",age)
# print ("Marks,",marks,".Ohhh...")

# practice question
# num1 = float(input("Enter the first number"))
# num2 = float(input("Enter the second number"))
# print("Sum of num1 and num2 :",num1+num2)
# Point to be noted :Input() always give us a string that's why we have to convert them into int or float.

# WAP to input side of a square and print it's area.
# side = float(input("Enter the side of the square "))
# print("Area of the square: ",side ** 2)

# WAP to input 2 floating point numbers and print their average.

# val1 = float(input("Enter the first value "))
# val2 = float(input("Enter the second value "))
# print ("Average of two numbers is",(val1+val2)/2)

# WAP to input 2 int numbers, a and b
# Print True if a is greater than or equal to b.If not print False.

a = int(input("Enter the first number "))
b = int(input("Enter the second number "))

print(a >= b)
