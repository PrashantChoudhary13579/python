#1.

# num1 = float(input("Enter the first number"))
# num2 = float(input("Enter the second number"))
# print("Sum of num1 and num2 :",num1+num2)
# Point to be noted :Input() always give us a string that's why we have to convert them into int or float.

# 2. WAP to input side of a square and print it's area.
# side = float(input("Enter the side of the square "))
# print("Area of the square: ",side ** 2)

# 3. WAP to input 2 floating point numbers and print their average.

# val1 = float(input("Enter the first value "))
# val2 = float(input("Enter the second value "))
# print ("Average of two numbers is",(val1+val2)/2)

# 4. WAP to input 2 int numbers, a and b
# Print True if a is greater than or equal to b.If not print False.

a = int(input("Enter the first number "))
b = int(input("Enter the second number "))

print(a >= b)
