#In this file we will learn about the operator in the python and also many more things...
# Operands, operators
# Arithmetic operators
a = 5 
b = 2
sum = a+b
# print (sum)
# print (a+b)
# print (a-b)
# print (a*b)
# print (a/b)
# print (a**b)
# print (a%b)

# Relational Operator
# print(a>b) # True
# print(a<b) # False
# print(a==b)# False
# print(a!=b)# True

# assignment operator
num = 10 
# num = num +10
print("num :",num)
num -= 5
print("num :",num)

# Logical operator

print(not False)
print(not True)

a = 50 
b = 30 
print(not (a>b)) # False

# and + or operator
val1 = True
val2 = True
print("and operator: ", not val1 and val2)
print("and operator: ", not val1 or val2)
print("and operator: ", not val1 or not val2)
print("answer is : ", (a==b) or (a>b))
